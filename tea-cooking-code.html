    <h3>Let suppose we are going to make tea for two people one for you and one for your love, Just kidding guys.</h3>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Take 200 or 250ml of water and boil for 2-3 minutes at low flame.</li>
        <li>Now add sugar 2 tablespoon as default, you can add or reduce as your taste.</li>
        <li>Take 2 or 3cm ginger and black pepper and grind them and add them, do this if you want ginger tea. </li>
        <li>Now add tea leaf (chaypatti) about 1 tablespoon at low flame.</li>
        <li>Now wait for 5-6 minutes, you can play a song in this interval.</li>
        <li>Now boil the tea at high flame 2-3 times, as tea flowing out of utensils get it as low flame and again take
            to high flame when it comes to previous position.</li>
        <li>As you guys know without love there is no taste in the tea so make the tea with love and serve it with love.
        </li>
